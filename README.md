# PugetSoundTransit
A Train and Ferry Schedule to showcase database application through Firebase
The admin section showcases an understanding of Moment.js and firebase, allowing a user to push info and have moment.js manipulate it to predict the timing of events, and showing all of the logged entries on the page.  

The page also showcases an understanding of parallax scrolling effect with CSS, and there are two more sections that are still in progress.  (This is a minimally viable webpage, currently.  It does what it was assigned to do, but will be updated.  If you look at the firebase, you will see that there are train routes with predetermined stops.  The code will show the day's remaining train stops when clicked on a city.  In routes, you will be able to select a starting and stopping point and it will tell you how to get there.  (Not all routes go to all cities.)
